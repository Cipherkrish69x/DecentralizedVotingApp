# Decentralized Voting Application Expected Outputs

## 1. Smart Contract Deployment Output
When you run the migration command to deploy your smart contracts, you should see output similar to this in your terminal:

Compiling your contracts...
Everything is up to date, there is nothing to compile.

Starting migrations...

## 2. React Application Output
When you start your React application and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`, you should see the following:

- A simple user interface displaying the title "Voting DApp".
- Your Ethereum account address, which indicates the connected wallet.
- A list of candidates with their names and vote counts, along with a "Vote" button next to each candidate.

**Example UI Output:**
```plaintext
Voting DApp
Your Account: 0x123456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789a

Candidates:
- Alice - 0 votes [Vote]
- Bob - 0 votes [Vote]
3. Voting Functionality
When a user clicks the "Vote" button for a candidate, the application should:

Send a transaction to the Ethereum blockchain to record the vote.
Update the vote count in the UI.
Expected Behavior:

After voting for a candidate, the updated count should reflect immediately in the UI.
If a user attempts to vote again, they should receive an error message stating that they have already voted.
Example After Voting:

plaintext
Copy code
Voting DApp
Your Account: 0x123456789abcdef123456789abcdef123456789a

Candidates:
- Alice - 1 votes [Vote]
- Bob - 0 votes [Vote]
4. Error Handling
If any errors occur, such as trying to vote more than once, the application should display a message indicating the issue.

Example Error Message:

plaintext
Copy code
Error: You have already voted.
5. Testing Output
When you run your unit tests using truffle test, the output will indicate whether the tests passed or failed.

Example Testing Output:
