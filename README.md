# Decentralized Voting Application

## Overview

This is a decentralized voting application built on the Ethereum blockchain. It utilizes smart contracts written in Solidity, a React frontend for user interaction, and Web3.js for blockchain integration. The application allows users to cast votes for candidates in a secure and transparent manner.

## Features

- **Blockchain-based voting**: Ensures the integrity and transparency of the voting process.
- **Smart Contracts**: Developed using Solidity, deployed on the Ethereum test network (Rinkeby/Ropsten).
- **Frontend**: Built with React, providing a user-friendly interface.
- **Real-time updates**: The application fetches and displays the current vote counts for each candidate.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity
- **Frontend Framework**: React
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Web3.js
- **Development Tools**: Truffle, Ganache, npm
- **Testing Framework**: Mocha, Chai
